# ShoppingList

A webpage based online shopping list, this was made 4 years ago back when we still used class components a lot. Can't say I miss them.

My idea is to give this project a revamp.

## This is how it used to look

### Notable feedback

- It's not really clear that this would be a shopping list.
- After a refresh, the content is reset to its original state.
- Not really responsive for either Desktop or Mobile.
- Styling could do with a make-over.

## To do's & Ideas

- [x] Move to Next.js because SSR is awesome
- [x] Restyle page using shadcn/ui and tailwind
- [x] Use local storage to store list of items
  
### Known bugs
- [x] Default value on selects don't really work

### Nice to haves

- [x] Add suggested recipes to add ingredients to shopping list
- [ ] Instead of local storage, use a small db to store shopping list
- [ ] Crud system to add your own recipes
- [ ] Make it clear the badge is clickable
